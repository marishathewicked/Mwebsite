A picture of Minsk hangs in my room on the wall. It shows a part of the city in the evening. Street lamps are lighting dimly. High-rise buildings are standing proudly above ground. If I'm looking at the picture for more than five minutes, I want to touch it. I know that I will feel a hard paper surface, but every time I believe that I will feel a warm summer breeze.<br>
I love Minsk. I love its space, streets and parks. I love it entirely. I admire its special beauty. I know there are many problems but any big city has them. <br>
The oldest surviving part of Minsk is Trinity Hill. This is one of the most comfortable places. There are many small houses with colorful roofs and stone-paved streets. It has the romantic spirit of 19th-century Minsk. It is located on the bank of the Svisloch River.<br>
The quay is very well-cared for it has impressive size. I love to walk there. The river is blue and looks like the sea. If you walk along the waterfront you will find a huge park. There are a lot of different trails leading through the park.<br>
I remember the last time I was there. I spent the whole day running errands. My legs were hurting terribly. But when I needed to choose between going on foot to the subway or taking a bus, it was a poor time to be thinking. I was going on foot.  Minsk always gives me a new burst of energy. Every breath and every step is a sense of freedom. Dear reader, can you imagine how absolutely happy halfwit smiles? So I smile like that when I get off the plane in Minsk.<br>
Another great attraction located near Trinity Hill is The National Academic Bolshoi Opera and Ballet Theater of the Republic of Belarus. It is one of the biggest theaters in Europe and an architectural landmark of Minsk. A small park lies at the feet of this unique building. There are a lot of benches and a large powerful fountain. A lot of people relax there during summer. However, my favorite place is a statue of three ballerinas located near the fountain. They are made of metal, but they are as airy as alive. They are involved in a very sensuous dance. They are perfection. They are angels in ballet shoes. Ballet is an admirable art. It is perfection in every movement. It is lightness and the price of this lightness is sweat and blood. When I watch ballet my heart stops beating and begins again with the last bend of troupe.<br>
Minsk is rich in incomparable places. It is beautiful in any season. It wakes up and stretches its arms-branches to the Sun in spring. Spring breath of Minsk is gorgeous. There are parks getting green, ice caps, with are hiding under roofs of old houses, are melting away, birds are singing love songs. <br>
Minsk is hot in summer. Its breath is heavy and burning. Although summer's evening in Minsk is an unforgettable experience. Actually, my favorite time is twilight, when the Sun almost sets but its is not dark yet. Twilight is a magical time. It is when Minsk is dressed in colorful lights and the city is getting brighter with each passing hour. <br>
Autumn in Minsk is terribly rainy. Oh God. I miss thunderstorms so much. I want to feel how air is hot before a storm, how the sky is getting dark, how lightning are cutting sky, how thunder are screaming. I have an incomparable feeling when I sense the tension in the air, the breath of thunderstorm.<br>
It becomes stuffy, even though the wind is strong and gusty. It electrifies the air around and it seems dense. The wind is very quiet, as if it is afraid of something. A brace of shake the powerful rush slap in the face. The sky is getting darker with every minute. The storm is not hurrying. It is forcing everything to beg to show its face. Finally the first heavy drops of rain are coming down. It is only a few large heavy drops. After a few seconds of rest, the first rumble of thunder summons lady. The heavy rain batters houses, cars and people.<br>
Winter. Winter is a magical time. Minsk dresses in a white coat of snow. I love snow. People are unique like snowflakes. I love walking in snow. There are many snow storms, but also there are many days when snow falls softly and gently. I like to feel light chill when snowflakes touch my face. I carefully blink when snowflakes get stuck on my eyelashes. No matter how old I am, I will always be catching snowflakes with hands like a kid, jumping in snow tossing my face to sky. I will always be willing to try the taste of snow.
