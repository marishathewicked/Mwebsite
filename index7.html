I found an envelope in my postbox last Friday morning. Inside the envelope, there was an invitation for one to a private party called "Silver Flamingos."  I would have to be at the specified address at midnight. I was hesitating to go for a long time. Eventually, I wore a plain black dress, black shoes with small heels and a small silver pendant in the form of the moon. With I found at the house of my grand-grandmother the last time. No one from my family knew where it came from. This pendant is so valuable to me as a connection to my ancestors.<br>
I came by taxi to the appointed place at midnight. There was an unremarkable house. I knocked. The heavy door opened. I entered. At the doorstep, I met a short man in a suit with a pink tie. His eyes sparkled and he smiled broadly.<br>
- Can I see your invitation? - he asked.<br>
-Yes of course. - I answered.<br>
He looked at the invitation and then he made a gesture.<br>
- Welcome! - he added.<br>
I took a few steps and saw something incredible. I found myself in the middle of a huge room. Large pink crystal chandelier hung overhead. The floor looked like a mirror. In it's reflection, I could see the whole ceiling, including the chandelier. However I couldn't see myself there. I was unsuccessfully trying to peer into the reflection but no one was there. I looked at the left corner of the room. There were three large plush chairs near a fireplace. Two of them were occupied by ballerinas. The first ballerina was a white swan, and the second one was a black swan. The third chair was empty. The ballerinas were talking and laughing. Flames from the fireplace were overhearing their conversation and were laughing with them. I walked further into the depths of the room. I walked across a long corridor. There were scenic pictures. They were from all over the world. There were drawings of lush green forests, snow-capped mountains and sand storms in desert. Also there were portraits of unfamiliar people from different epochs. After I found myself in usual nightclub. So I thought at first. Having looked closely, I noticed that people were dancing strangely. All of them were dancing like robots. I was scared by this spectacle.<br>
- Would you like a drink? - a voice asked me.<br>
I turned around. Behind me, there was a typical guy in a colored T-shirt, jeans and sneakers. He was holding a glass of a red bubbling liquid.<br>
- What is it? - I was curious.<br>
- It is hot cranberry juice. Don't you feel cold? - he asked.<br>
Just at that moment, I felt very cold. I hugged myself and ran up the stairs. The next moment, I was in a small passage room. The right wall was hung with golden curtains. They were radiating warmth. I touched the fabric carefully. The curtain was so hot. I was pushing back the curtain and instantly stopped. I was astonished. The sand was pouring in at my feet. I saw an African landscape in front of me. It was hot. Giraffes were walking on hot sand under the high blue sky. I could feel the heat on my face. It was incredible. I wanted to make a step forward but I stopped. I drew the curtains and came back to shadow.<br>
The library was the next room. There were books everywhere. They lay on the shelves, on the table and the sofa. Some of them were stacked on the floor.
- Hello. Can I help you? -  a girl with curly purple hair asked me.<br>
- I ... I do not know - I said.<br>
- Would you like a cup of coffee? - she asked.<br>
- Yes, thank you - I said.<br>
I was amazed. It was a strange magnetic and, at the same time, grim place. <br>  
- You can sit there – the girl pointed to a table near the window.<br>
A man was sitting at the table. I went to the table across the room.<br>
- Can I sit here? - I asked.<br>
- Yes, please - he said smilingly.<br>
He was tall and good looking. He was wearing a dark blue suit. There was a pocket on his chest with a red pocket square stripped with gold. Embroidered letter «J» was on the pocket square.<br>
There was a quiet street with lots of lights outside the window.<br>
- Where an I? - I asked.<br>
- It is a garden! - he said.<br>
- Actually, is it a library or .... - I was surprised by a sudden pause, while I looked through the window.<br>
Outside the window was an old apple orchard.<br>
- Here you go, your apple -  the girl with purple hair said.<br>
A baked apple laid in front of me on a plate. I took a spoon and tasted the flesh of the apple. It was very tasty. Sweet smell of baked apples with cinnamon rejoiced me. I stopped being afraid. I began to wonder what I would see next. For some time I was speaking with Mr. J. He is a fascinating companion. He told me many stories about himself.<br>
If you let me, I'll tell you about them next time dear reader. <br>
I thanked Mr. J, and continued my way.<br>
Next I was on a bridge. Small boats were floating above water. There were people in large heavy dresses in those boats. They looked like characters from the 18th century. The women wore a lot of jewelry, and the men had swords. Two of them were trying to fight from different boats. A girl with long red hair was laughing over them.<br>
- Sorry, but we are closed - the man who I met first said it.<br>
He carried me down to the exit.<br>
I became aware only when I was in taxi on my way. I was drawing a crown on the steamy window and trying to understand what I saw.<br>
It definitely was the most crazy night of my life. Or it could be.<br>
