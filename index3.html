There is strong rain behind the window. Wind is jumbling drops of rain and yellow leaves. Actually, I'm taking comfort in this cold wet beauty. 
I have to write three articles about Dublin. Ok. Let me start.
Every single place I know in Dublin is associated with an adventure. It's bad or good memories. Our whole life is composed of memories. Of course we are trying to forget bad experiences and to keep reminding ourselves about light in our lives. But sometimes it's really difficult to manage yourself.<br>
I would like to tell you a story. Firstly let me introduce the hero of this story. It's one of my friends. Her name is Alex. She started learning German some time ago. It's difficult for her because she has an engineering mind. During the first week of class she could find time only for sleep. Stress was enormous. She had to pass a level test. 
It should be pointed out, she always tries to find the right answer because of her attitude to life. She usually asks a lot of questions about what she can't understand in the class. Some of the teachers think that she want to attack them but it's not true. It's just an attempt to understand everything.<br>
The evening before the test she was like an electric ball. The test started at 11 a.m. It wasn't that difficult. After the test, students exchanged their results and started to check them. During the check Alex was asking the teacher about some things. It was a spirited discussion. Check had been already finished when one of the students asked teacher about a task from the test. Alex knew that it was her test. She made logic mistake and she knew that task she messed up. <br>
She was staring at her test when the teacher came up. He looked over the exercise and then he checked name on the first page. <br>
“Entire exercise is incorrect “- he said<br>
Alex was shocked. She couldn’t understand why he checked name. What did that check mean? Why did he check name?  
She understood her mistake in the exercise. But why did he check name? 
She was confused.<br>
After the class she asked him. She started to apologize for her importunity in the discussion and finally she said about what she saw. The first he started defending himself.<br>
“But I saw” -she said.<br>
“ Ok “ - he answered.<br>
After “Ok” her thoughts stopped.<br>
Every person is a vessel with colorful feelings. Your state of mind depends on what is inside your vessel. Everything around you is filling it. Sometimes the vessel is filled so fast and so much that you can't handle it.<br>
When she was going home she was trying to not cry. It was hard. At the stairs, in front of her house, her breathing rattled in her throat. But she raised a whisper out of her stunned chest, - “You are fine. Calm”. For one moment she forgot how to breath. It scared her. When she finally found herself at her room she started crying. Her vessel was full. She was crying not because of the teacher or this situation. It was just because her vessel was full with negative emotions. And it was last drop. <br>
Alex turned on her playlist. There was one song called “Someone Loves Us” by Dario Marianelli. She stopped crying. <br>
We all have at least one person who loves us. Sometimes we forget about it.<br>
We all are different. We all have problems and life experience. <br>
Alex was thinking about it when she arrived at conclusions that maybe it was just a bad day.
“Maybe I was mistaken in my judgment. Maybe I am so complicated. Maybe sometimes it is better to say “Ok” than to try to prove something ”<br>
Why did I tell you this story? Because I am sure that everyone is incredible mix of feelings and emotions. Everyone has angels and demons inside. But the most important is that everyone has light inside. You just should find it inside yourself or inside people who are around you. It was the first reason.<br>
Secondly, it involves the main topic. Our descriptions of a place is directly connected with how you feel there. For Alex that stairs will be black until something good happens there.
And now I want to share my places of Dublin.<br>
It's Phoenix Park where I walked with a dog. I remember one day which completely changed my perception of Phoenix Park. <br>
It was a rainy day. And I had to have a walk with my sweet dog Micron. Micron is a small dog. She doesn't like rain. I carried her to the park. I sat down to pet her because she as shivering. She jumped on my legs and nestled up to me. It's difficult to explain. That feeling, when someone, who you care about and love has need of you.<br>
Second place after Phoenix Park is Hippety's cafe in the city center. Almost every Sunday I visit that cafe with my good friend Kate. We speak about different things, share emotions, give piece of advice to each other.  We relax there. I like this place and it's because of her. Because I feel comfortable with her. I like this place because I have good memories about it. 
Third place is … Wait a minute. I can't decide.<br>
I like one of the Starbucks cafes near the canal because I met one of my best friends Jane there. She is amazing person. I like her so much.<br>
I like the square inside Trinity College because my friend Ilia ad I walk very often there. Usually we speak and drink coffee. He is very self confident. I am very often influenced rightly by him.  <br>
Another place is a huge book store in the city center. I bought my first book in English there. My friend Andrew was there with me and helped me with choosing. It was fun. Andrew is very shy and gentle. I like spending time with him. He is constantly trying to understand what I say. I appreciate it.<br>
I like Accents Coffee and Tea Cafe. There are many books and an amazing atmosphere. And you can guess why I think like that... Often I drink coffee there with one of the kindest people which I know. Trax is an excellent extraordinary chef. I never tried anything tastier than his food. 
As a result I would like to say that you have at list one person who loves you, cares about you, likes what you do and needs you. Only good memories have value.
