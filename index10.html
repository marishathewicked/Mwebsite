 Morning...<br>
The sun fired windows of brick houses.<br>
Gray clouds decay in it's gaze.<br>
The light looks into each window trying to find a companion.<br>
The green dome of tower, rising above the houses, is crying and calling on the light.<br>
But the sun is not interested in the age-old stone.<br>
The gulls,  tied to the ground, are laughing at the human statue.<br>
The clouds are whispering to it: "Wait!"<br>
Sleepy streets begging the sun to deliver them from heaven tears.<br>
Once beautiful, leaves are dyeing under the feet of passers.<br>
I want to touch the air.<br>
The wind is gliding through my fingers.<br>
It wants to take my hand.<br>
It wants to share his knowledge with someone.<br>
It's alone in it's travels.<br>
It wants to grab my hand, but it can't.<br>
It's muggy. My scarf is holding tightly to my shoulders.<br>
We are feeling hot. I'm trying to take my wool fetters off.<br>
The huge scarf clutched at me like a cat.<br>
Freedom. The killer of breath have been locked up in my bag.<br>
The trees dig their claws-branches into the gray sky.<br>
Their hearts have stopped until spring.<br>
The gulls,  tied to the ground, are laughing at the green dome.<br>
Waitâ€¦<br>
