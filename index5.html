Somewhere very far away, in the middle of endless woods, at a small clearing, a little fox-cud is sitting. His name is Foxik. He is staring with innocent admiration at the falling stars from the night sky. Their light is reflecting in his large full of wonder eyes. A faint smile is lighting up his sweet little face. His black nose is reaching out for the sparkling sky.  He is sitting very quietly, as if he is afraid to frighten off the flying stars. They are so busy with their inimitable fall that they aren't noticing a small observer.<br>
Suddenly one of the stars stopped when she noticed a red lump who is staring at her.<br>
- Why are you following me? -  The star asked with majestic voice.<br>
Foxik moved from fright.<br>
- You ... you ... you are so beautiful, bright. You know how to fly – Foxik said flabbily.<br>
- I am falling - not flying, Dumbo – The star explained.<br>
- Why are you falling? -  he asked surprisingly.<br>
- So as to the wishes come true. -  The star said.<br>
- The wishes - Foxik repeated.<br>
-Yes. We live in the night sky, look down upon the world and when someone really needs magic we come of our spots. We fly down and we give a magic light to who needs it. - The star explained.<br>
- How interesting – Foxik said groovy.<br>
- It is quite late and you should go to bed -  The star said shining.<br>
- Can I sit here for a little more? - he is begged.<br>
- Come tomorrow, you will see many more bright falling and twinkling stars in the night sky.
- But tomorrow you probably will not be here – he said sadly.<br>
- Tomorrow here will be the new stars and they will be as vivid and magical as I am – The star said smiling.<br>
- You promise? - Foxik asked.<br>
- I promise – The bright star said.
